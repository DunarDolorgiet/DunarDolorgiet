It is a tiny 120mm^3 print area built with 1515 extrusions. It encloses naturally so printing ABS is possible. Currently, all single mechanical parts for V1 and V2 can be printed on a V0 bed. The design accounts for stock Makerbeam XL extrusion lengths (which come tapped) and standard MGN7 linear rail lengths. |

It is simpler to build compared to V2. It encloses naturally so ABS or other temperature sensitive filaments can be printed easily. It uses linear rails for the X and Y axis.  |
| <img src="https://github.com/DunarDolorgiet/DunarDolorgiet/raw/master/voron2-2.4.png" width=130 /> | [VORON2](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2) | 2.4 |V2 is a modified coreXY design with a static bed and a gantry that moves along the Z axis. It is a complex build that includes 4-point gantry tramming to align to the print surface, dual MCUs, and other unique features. It is also designed to be fully enclosed so it prints ABS or similar filaments very well. Due to the linear rails the design is scalable all the way up to 350^3. |

It is a CoreXZ design so the print head is belt driven in both the X and Z axis eliminating the typical leadscrew Z drive allowing for very fast Z movement speeds and less weight on the grantry by moving the X motor to the frame.   The stiff 3030/3060 contructed frame is just large enough to cover the entire swing of the bed and allows for a natural enclosure. |
